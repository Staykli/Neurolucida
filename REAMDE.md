Neural Network Visualization Projects

This repository contains a series of web-based 3D neural network visualization projects using Three.js. 
The projects demonstrate neuron structures, network activity, clusters, and dynamic signaling waves in an interactive and visually compelling way.

Purpose
 • Create interactive 3D visualizations of neurons and synapses.
 • Showcase network activity via colored impulses and traveling waves.
 • Artistically and scientifically represent brain-like structures.
 • Add atmospheric effects (fog, particles) for depth and immersion.

Features
 • Procedural generation of neuron branches and clusters
 • Active signaling waves traveling along synapses
 • Cluster interactions, where impulses in one cluster trigger neighboring clusters
 • Neuron-type-based colored impulses:
 • Excitatory: blue-cyan, fast bursts
 • Inhibitory: orange-red, slow waves
 • Modulatory: yellow-green, medium speed
 • Fog and particle effects for depth and motion
 • Interactive camera controlled by mouse movement

Technologies
 • Three.js (https://threejs.org/) — 3D graphics
 • HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript — frontend
 • BufferGeometry, Points, LineSegments — optimized rendering for large numbers of objects
 • Fully browser-based, no backend required
